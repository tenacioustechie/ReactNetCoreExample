# Example React App 

Created for my Nephew to demonstrate .Net Core React App functionality. 

# Build

After cloning the repository, you will need to install dependencies. 

```
cd SolarDataApp\ClientApp
npm i
```

Then Open in Visual Studio and try 'runing' the solution. Usually F5 will do that. 

# Editing

You can open the server side code in Visual Studio, however the client React app is a little clunky to edit as VS tries to reformat it. So you are better of editing the client side app in Visual Studio Code.
